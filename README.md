# Plant-Health-monitoring
🌿 Plant Health Monitoring System

A smart Plant Health Monitoring System that leverages sensor data and data analysis techniques to monitor plant conditions and assess overall plant health. This project aims to assist farmers, gardeners, and researchers in making data-driven decisions for better crop yield and plant care.

🚀 Project Overview

Plant health is highly dependent on environmental factors such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Manual monitoring is inefficient and error-prone.

This project provides an automated solution that:

Collects plant and environmental data

Analyzes plant health parameters

Helps identify unhealthy conditions early

Supports informed decision-making for irrigation and care

Key Objectives

Monitor critical plant growth parameters

Analyze sensor data to detect unhealthy patterns

Provide insights for timely intervention

Build a scalable foundation for smart agriculture systems
